	 * LinkedList :
	 * ------------ 
	 * public class LinkedList<E> extends
	 * AbstractSequentialList<E> implements List<E>, Deque<E>, Cloneable,
	 * Serializable
	 * 
	 * It is a predefined class available in java.util package under List interface.
	 * 
	 * It is ordered by index position like ArrayList except the elements (nodes)
	 * are doubly linked to one another. This linkage provide us new method for
	 * adding and removing the elements from the middle of LinkedList.
	 * 
	 * The important thing is, LikedList may iterate more slowely than ArrayList but
	 * LinkedList is a good choice when we want to insert or delete the elements
	 * frequently in the list.
	 * 
	 * From jdk 1.5 onwards LinkedList class has been enhanced to support basic
	 * queue operation by implementing Deque<E> interface.
	 * 
	 * ArrayList is using Array data structure but LinkedList class is using
	 * LinkedList data structure.
	 * 
	 * Constructor:
	 *  -------------
	 * It has 2 constructors
	 * 
	 * 1) LinkedList list1 = new LinkedList(); It will create a LinkedList object
	 * with 0 capacity.
	 * 
	 * 2) LinkedList list2 = new LinkedList(Collection c); Interconversion between
	 * the collection
